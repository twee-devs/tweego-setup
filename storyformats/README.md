# Twine Story Formats

It's up to you to decide what format you want to use, [M. C. DeMarco](http://mcdemarco.net/tools/hyperfic/twine/catalog/) maintains a full list, but here are some of the common ones:

* [Sugarcube](https://github.com/tmedwards/sugarcube-2) [download (you want the Twine 2.1 version)](https://github.com/tmedwards/sugarcube-2/releases/latest)
* [Harlow](https://foss.heptapod.net/games/harlowe/)
